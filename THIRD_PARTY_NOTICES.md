## Dependencies fetched during a build

Gradle resolves Android/AndroidX/Compose, Kotlin/coroutines, OkHttp/Okio and test/build dependencies from the declared repositories. Versions and direct selections are recorded in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`, `build.gradle.kts` and `app/build.gradle.kts`; unused catalog aliases do not mean those libraries are included in the app. Their published packages carry their own licences and notices. Preserve the notices applicable to resolved dependencies when packaging a binary for public distribution. This local source checkpoint is not a completed public binary distribution package.
